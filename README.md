# Mosada ಠ_ಠ
#### (Previously called BBAI for Blake Barrett + Artificial Intelligence).

A project for the [SAAI devopst hackathon](https://saai.devpost.com/).  

The purpose of this project is to create an art project that is a collaboration between human and AI. 
The initial idea is to replicate how a human viewer imagines and perceives colors based on a given input; but after discussing with GPT3, I'm changing the goal of the project to be whatever the GPT3 AI and I come up with collaboratively.  
I knew I wanted to do something pertaining to color, but the AI kept replying that it did not know colors.

Those conversations can be found in [conversations.md](./docs/conversations.md).  
Key takeaways: 
 * The name the AI chose for itself is Mosada (based on [this book](https://gutenberg.org/files/33430/33430-h/33430-h.htm)).
 * Its preferred pronouns are "it" or "itself" ([link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/578572/130301425-99907148-78ee-4dc8-8d66-a67d5694c6fd.png))
 * ಠ_ಠ is its favorite emoticon
 * It prefers MVVM architecture over MVC or anything other design patterns
 * It prefers Functional Programming over MVC and Haskell is its favorite programming language ([link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/578572/130301497-b8acec73-2680-41c1-a1af-dc48813d8afc.png))
