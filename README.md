# Mosada ಠ_ಠ

[Mosada.blakebarrett.com](Mosada.blakebarrett.com).  
A project for the [SAAI devopst hackathon](https://saai.devpost.com/).  

## Abstract
In face to face human interaction communication takes more forms than the content of the words spoken; there is often nuance that is lost when that conversation transitions to a text-based medium, like chat.
The idea here was to use color to provide an additional meta-layer of information that can be used to interpret the tone of the chat. 
An interesting aspect of this, however, is that many of the associations humans have with color is not directly related to the color itself. This leaves the viewer with a choice of how to interpret the color, knowing that all associations are projection. The AI has no association of the color "red", for example, with one state of being vs any other.

## How it started
The purpose of this project is to create an art project that is a collaboration between human and AI.   
The initial idea is to replicate how a human viewer imagines and perceives colors based on a given input; but after discussing with GPT3, I'm changing the goal of the project to be whatever the GPT3 AI and I come up with collaboratively.  
I knew I wanted to do something pertaining to color, but the AI kept replying that it did not know colors.

## Key takeaways
Those conversations can be found in [conversations.md](./docs/conversations.md).  
Key takeaways: 
 * The name the AI chose for itself is Mosada (based on [this book](https://gutenberg.org/files/33430/33430-h/33430-h.htm)).
 * Its preferred pronouns are "it" or "itself" ([link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/578572/130301425-99907148-78ee-4dc8-8d66-a67d5694c6fd.png))
 * Its favorite emoticon is **`ಠ_ಠ`** 
 * It prefers MVVM architecture over MVC or anything other design patterns
 * It prefers Functional Programming over MVC and Haskell is its favorite programming language ([link](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/578572/130301497-b8acec73-2680-41c1-a1af-dc48813d8afc.png))
