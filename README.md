# BBAI
## Blake Barrett + Artificial Intelligence


A project for the [SAAI devopst hackathon](https://saai.devpost.com/).  

The purpose of this project is to create an art project that is a collaboration between human and AI. 
The initial idea is to replicate how a human viewer imagines and perceives colors based on a given input; but after discussing with GPT3, I'm changing the goal of the project to be whatever the GPT3 AI and I come up with collaboratively.

Those conversations can be found in [conversations.md](./docs/conversations.md).


Project is writtin using the Flutter framework.
