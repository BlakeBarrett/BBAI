## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the app [Snse](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snse/id1442747058), which was itself inspired by Alphonse Mucha's series "[The Times of the Day](http://www.muchafoundation.org/en/gallery/themes/theme/art-posters/object/278)". Mucha composed four posters each using a different main color: Pink for the dawn, Green for the day, Orange for sunset, Blue for evening. Snse lets human users express how they feel by choosing a color that describes how they feel, building up a palette of moods over time. Each human has different associations with each color, so everyone's palette will end up being different. After watching a few video interviews with GPT-3 I wondered what its palette would look like.

## What it does
AI Chat that uses colors to betray the AI's mood.

## How we built it
After deciding on an idea, I applied to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for GPT-3 access and wrote the entire client app using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework -- there isn't a "server side" component to this beyond the assets being hosted on [Firebase](https://firebase.com).

## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

## What we learned
Humans make many associations with colors; some conscious other not. Many can be cultural, like the blue/pink boy/girl prescriptions others are more emergent, like red being the color of blood, has associations with passion, violence, lust, rage, arousal, etc. This is widely accepted as the way terms for Colors evolve in human Language ([ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Color_Terms)).
